  abstract        = {Graph theory is a flourishing discipline containing a body
                  of beautiful and powerful theorems of wide applicability. Its
                  explosive growth in recent years is mainly due to its role as
                  an essential structure underpinning modern applied mathematics
                  computer science, combinatorial optimization, and operations
                  research in particular but also to its increasing application
                  in the more applied sciences. The versatility of graphs makes
                  them indispensable tools in the design and analysis of
                  communication networks, for instance. The primary aim of this
                  book is to present a coherent introduction to the subject,
                  suitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and
                  beginning graduate students in mathematics and computer
                  science. It provides a systematic treatment of the theory of
                  graphs without sacrificing its intuitive and aesthetic appeal.
                  Commonly used proof techniques are described and illustrated,
                  and a wealth of exercises - of varying levels of difficulty -
                  are provided to help the reader master the techniques and
                  reinforce their grasp of the material. A second objective is
                  to serve as an introduction to research in graph theory. To
                  this end, sections on more advanced topics are included, and a
                  number of interesting and challenging open problems are
                  highlighted and discussed in some detail. Despite this more
                  advanced material, the book has been organized in such a way
                  that an introductory course on graph theory can be based on
                  the first few sections of selected chapters. Visit the graph

                  engaging freshness of style that is the hallmark of active
                  mathematics. It covers the core material of the subject with
                  concise yet reliably complete proofs, while offering glimpses
                  of more advanced methods in each field by one or two deeper
                  results, again with proofs given in full detail. The book can
                  be used as a reliable text for an introductory course, as a
                  graduate text, and for self-study. From the reviews: This
                  outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on
                  the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming
                  the standard textbook for graph theory. Acta Scientiarum
                  Mathematiciarum Deep, clear, wonderful. This is a serious book
