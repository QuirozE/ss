abstract = {This standard textbook of modern graph theory, now in its fifth edition, combines the authority of a classic with the engaging freshness of style that is the hallmark of active mathematics. It covers the core material of the subject with concise yet reliably complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced methods in each field by one or two deeper results, again with proofs given in full detail. The book can be used as a reliable text for an introductory course, as a graduate text, and for self-study. From the reviews: This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory. Acta Scientiarum Mathematiciarum Deep, clear, wonderful. This is a serious book about the heart of graph theory. It has depth and integrity. Persi Diaconis & Ron Graham, SIAM Review The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory. Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications Succeeds dramatically ... a hell of a good book. MAA Reviews A highlight of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the Seymour-Robertson theory of graph minors. Mathematika ... like listening to someone explain mathematics.

abstract = {Author Peter Pacheco uses a tutorial approach to show students how to develop effective parallel programs with MPI, Pthreads, and OpenMP. The first undergraduate text to directly address compiling and running parallel programs on the new multi-core and cluster architecture, An Introduction to Parallel Programming explains how to design, debug, and evaluate the performance of distributed and shared-memory programs. User-friendly exercises teach studentshow to compile, run and modify example programs. Key features:Takes a tutorial approach, starting with small programming examples and building progressively to more challenging examplesFocuses on designing, debugging and evaluating the performance of distributed and shared-memory programsExplains how to develop parallel programs using MPI, Pthreads, and OpenMP programming models}
