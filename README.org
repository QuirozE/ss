#+title: GPU accelerated PSO

Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization using [[https://juliagpu.org/][CUDA.jl]]. 

* Dependencies

The whole repository is a Julia project, so to get all Julia dependencies, it is enough to run

#+begin_src julia
julia> cd("path/to/project")
pkg> activate .
pkg> instantiate
#+end_src

Other than these, to run CUDA code, the GPU drivers and the [[https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit][Nvidia Toolkit]] must be installed.

Additionally, some ~C++~ examples use the [[https://www.boost.org/][Boost]] library.
